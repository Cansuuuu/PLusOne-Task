The file contains one PLusOneTask.ipynb and one main.py files with a json file. Any of the two can be chosen to run. The PLusOneTask.ipynb was created in Jupyter Notebook. main.py was created in Pycharm.


There are two json files; one of them is the original one and the second one is the one that was modified with some extra items.


The codes contain two functions. Any of them can be run or they can be run together. The necessary comment lines were written. 


The functions have two outputs: The first one was made a comment line and it just shows the whole features of the items that contain Maple in topping. The necessary comment line was written. 

The second output is just the name of the items sorted alphabetically.
